\description{
The data used in Chapter 10, Table 9
}
\details{
The data in Table 10.9 is based upon the information from the student therapist example of the random-effects section. Assume that the director of the clinic decides to test for a difference across genders in the general severity ratings that graduate students assign to clients. If three male and three female clinical students are randomly selected to participate, and each is randomly assigned four clients with whom to do an intake interview, then we might obtain data like that shown in Table 10.9. Three of the trainees are males while the other three trainees are females. The trainees are nested within their particular gender.
